# React Music Pro
This React app allow users to search for music artists with the help of Spotify's API. The search pulls in basic data from an artist (profile picture, followers, genres, and music tracks along with preview clips).

## Note
In order for this app to work out of the box, you'll need to get an access token from Spotify. The access token allows you to make requests to Spotify's Web API. As of this writing, the access token expires every hour.

## How to get an access token from Spotify
